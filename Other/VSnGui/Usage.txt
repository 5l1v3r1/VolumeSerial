1. run logwindow it will show you what is going on
2. run vsngui. this program will allow you to configure what virtual serial numbers are for each drive
3. put the program path to run and hit "Run"

Now if the executed program tries to read the serial number, look at logwindow and see what happens.

You can change the serial number value on the fly. Just do not close VSnGui, instead select the drive, and put a new serial number value and press "SET"
